# Antib*IoT*ic: The Fog-based anti-malware for Internet of Things.

This is the official repository for **Antib*IoT*ic**.

We are constantly working to implement and improve **Antib*IoT*ic**. It is a lot of work, but we are doing our best! :)

We are working offline and we update this repository when we have a stable version of the code. Right now, the code included in this repository implements only a subset of the functionalities of **Antib*IoT*ic** and it is only intended as a proof-of-concept.


***Work in progress ...***
